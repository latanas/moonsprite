# Game Project "Weather Ready or Not"
DES310 was a game development module at Abertay University. We worked as team "Moonsprite" to create the serious game "Weather Ready or Not". In this game you try help a town prepare for a dangerous storm. This was based on client proposal by British Red Cross.


## Moonsprite Team
Team Members: Atanas L - UI/UX, Animation; Dominic R - Producer, Game Designer; Emma M - Environments Design; Murray G - Character Design; Maciej W - Programming; Nicole B - Sound Fx; Vasco F - Programming. Academic Tutor: C Michalakos

## Module Description
Individual students will be expected to contribute to their team by taking on a professional role suited to their area of study. As part of the module, all students will be expected to: communicate with clients and relevant stakeholders; participate in pitching and presentations; research and test technical pipelines; create project documentation and planning materials; and contribute to the iterative design and development of a final interactive prototype.

### Aims
The aim of this module is to provide the student with the ability to operate professionally as a subject specialist within a multidisciplinary development team, contributing to planning, presenting, prototyping, and production.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module the student should be able to:

1. Contribute to the development, testing, enhancement, and completion of a defined interactive media project.
2. Demonstrate the ability to fulfil and appraise their own defined professional role within a team, evaluating their contribution in relation to expectations of the comparable role in industry.
3. Demonstrate teamwork, communication, and professionalism through collaboration on- and delivery of- a team project.

Our clients were people from the British Red Cross. The brief we received from them can be found in .docs and you can find builds of the game we made in .builds. The .docs folder contains documents that we shared as a team, for more information and individual portfolios, you will have to contact team members specifically.
