These scenes are what make up the playable game

Don't edit these scenes unless it is specifically your job to do so
Only one person can make changes to them each merge
Otherwise we may run into merge conflicts
And scene merge conflicts are difficult to deal with

If you want to test your changes in a scene
Goto the Misc folder, and create a new folder named after your branch in there
Then create a scene in there and test your stuff
