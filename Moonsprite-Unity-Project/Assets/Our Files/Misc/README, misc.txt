This folder is intended for files that're made for testing purposes
Files that aren't going to be used in the final game
That doesn't mean all placeholders
If it's just the first version of something then put it in an appropriate folder

So, when using this folder, create a new folder in it, named after your branch
Don't re-use other folders, that could mean a merge conflict
If the folder does become too crowded, then someone will specifically be asked to delete all of them

The most common use of this folder will be stuff like temporary scenes 
Made to test changes in the engine
As we cannot all test changes on the same scene, that would cause a merge conflict

But you can use it for anything

========

Merge conflicts will happen whenever two people edit the same thing
Animation files for example, if two people edited the sample rate of the same file
Then you'd get a merge conflict

So you always need to make everyone aware of what you're working on
So that they don't edit those thingsr
